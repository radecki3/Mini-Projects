**Tableau Chicago Airbnb Project**

Here, I used data from Inside Airbnb (https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) to develop a dashboard of Chicago Airbnb rental data, which spans multiple years and includes thousands of listings.

Below is the full dashboard (viewable interactively at Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/martin.radecki/viz/ChicagoAirbnb_17431183571090/Dashboard1?publish=yes).

There are also some unseen joins, case statements, and outlier cleaning (via calculated fields) not included in the screenshots to polish up the data.
